# Backend formatter

## Status
Accepted

## Context
When multiple people are working on the same project, differences in formatters will result in regular automatic changes to code written by others. This can be prevented by implementing one single formatting standard.

## Decision
java-google-format will be used to format all backend code.

## Consequences
There will not be any automatic changes to code in the backend, which will reduce the complexity and volume of commits.
