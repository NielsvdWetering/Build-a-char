# Frontend formatter

## Status
Accepted

## Context
When multiple people are working on the same project, differences in formatters will result in regular automatic changes to code written by others. This can be prevented by implementing one single formatting standard.

## Decision
VSCode Prettier will be used to format all frontend code.

## Consequences
There will not be any automatic changes to code in the frontend, which will reduce the complexity and volume of commits.
